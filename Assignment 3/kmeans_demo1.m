%% Train a _k_-Means Clustering Algorithm
% Cluster data using _k_-means clustering, then plot the cluster regions.

% Load Fisher's iris data set.  Use the petal lengths and widths as predictors.

% The larger cluster seems to be split into a lower variance region and a
% higher variance region.  This might indicate that the larger cluster is
% two, overlapping clusters.

% Cluster the data.  Specify _k_ = 3 clusters.

%%
% |kmeans| uses the _k_-means++ algorithm for centroid initialization and
% squared Euclidean distance by default.  It is good practice to search for lower,
% local minima by setting the |'Replicates'| name-value pair argument.
%%
% |idx| is a vector of predicted cluster indices corrresponding to the
% observations in |X|.  |C| is a 3-by-2 matrix containing the final
% centroid locations.  
%%
% Use |kmeans| to compute the distance from each centroid to points on a
% grid. To do this, pass the centroids (|C|) and points on a grid to
% |kmeans|, and implement one iteration of the algorithm.

idx2Region = kmeans(XGrid,3,'Start',C);
    % Assigns each node in the grid to the closest centroid
%%
% |kmeans| displays a warning stating that the algorithm did not converge,
% which you should expect since the software only implemented one
% iteration.
